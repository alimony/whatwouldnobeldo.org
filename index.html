<p>Nowhere in his last will did Alfred Nobel himself mention any prize in the so called “economic sciences.” This prize was in fact created by the Swedish Central Bank in 1968 – more than 70 years after Nobel’s death. The cleverly named “Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel” was of course too much of a mouthful to avoid its obvious destiny of being shortened to a “Nobel Prize in Economics”. Under&shy;standably so in popular speech, but more worri&shy;some by the media and other insti&shy;tutions of critical and investi&shy;gative repu&shy;tation.</p>

<blockquote>In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. The Prize is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the Bank’s 300th anni&shy;versary.<br />

<p>The nomination criteria, selection process, prize money, and presen&shy;tation of the prize in economics are all care&shy;fully matched to those of the Nobel Prizes, to the point where they are hard to distin&shy;guish from each other. And so, for many years has the late coming prize in economics basked in the reflected glory of the five actual Nobel Prizes, the ones speci&shy;fied by Alfred Nobel in his testa&shy;ment. Never without contro&shy;versy though, as noted by the former chair&shy;man of the Nobel Foundation:</p>

<blockquote>Every now and then there are proposals to establish additional Nobel Prizes, for example in Mathematics or Environ&shy;mental science. The foundation as well as the prize juries have rejected such requests. They consider them&shy;selves bound by the test&shy;ament, wondering what it would lead to if new Nobel Prizes or equi&shy;valents were created. […] However, this principle has been departed from on one occasion, regarding the prize in economics. This prize must not be treated as a Nobel Prize and is for this reason titled Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. […] There was considerable doubt among the Nobel committees about accepting the prize. Propa&shy;ganda activities were intense, especially from the Governor of the Central Bank, Per Åsbrink. […] The prize in economics has continued causing contro&shy;versy.<br />

<!-- This is the above quote in its original wording in Swedish:
Då och då kommer förslag om att man borde inrätta ytterligare Nobelpris, till exempel i matematik eller i miljövård. Stiftelsen, liksom prisutdelarna, har avvisat sådana propåer. Man har ansett sig bunden av testamentet – och frågar sig också var man skulle hamna om man släppte fram nya Nobelpris eller motsvarande pris. […] I ett avseende har man emellertid frångått principen och inrättat ett nytt pris. Det gäller ekonomipriset. Det skall inte likställas med ett Nobelpris och kallas också Pris i ekonomiska vetenskaper till Alfreds Nobels minne. […] Det rådde stor tveksamhet inom Nobelinstanserna till att acceptera priset. Propagandaverksamheten för priset var intensiv, särskilt från riksbankschefen Per Åsbrinks sida. […] Ekonomipriset har också fortsättningsvis varit kontroversiellt. -->

<p>A letter was recently sent to the Nobel Foundation for further clari&shy;fication on the issue, the central questions being these:</p>

<blockquote>Do you consider it proper for an organ&shy;ization to describe a laureate of the Prize in Economics as a "Nobel Prize winner", or to describe the Prize in Economics as "the Nobel Prize in Economics"? What do you prefer when it comes to organ&shy;izations' public messaging regarding this?</blockquote>

<p>The reply from the Nobel Foundation reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="golden">Neither “the Nobel Prize in Economics” nor “Nobel Prize winner” are considered to be formally accurate desig&shy;nations by the Nobel Foundation or the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (the prize-awarding insti&shy;tution) in regards to the Prize in Economic Sciences. It does happen that media use these terms when referring to the Prize in Economic Sciences or Laureates in Economic Sciences.<br />
<br />
As for our prefe&shy;rences when it comes to public messaging, we refer to the formal desig&shy;nations: that of the prize being <strong>The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</strong>, or in short form: <strong>Prize in Economic Sciences</strong>; the formal designation of a recipient of the prize being <strong>Recipient(s) of Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</strong>, or in short form, <strong>Laureate(s) in Economic Sciences</strong>.</blockquote>

<p>The last will of Alfred Nobel clearly states the five areas in which a prize was to be awarded, namely physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace:</p>

<blockquote>The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. The said interest shall be divided into <strong>five</strong> equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of <strong>physics</strong>; one part to the person who shall have made the most important <strong>chemical discovery or improvement</strong>; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of <strong>physiology or medicine</strong>; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of <strong>literature</strong> the most outstanding work in an ideal direction; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for <strong>fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses</strong>. The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physio&shy;logical or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nation&shy;ality of the candi&shy;dates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandi&shy;navian or not.<br />

<p>Alfred Nobel did not mention any prize in economics.</p>

<p class="larger">For this simple reason, <strong>there is no Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences</strong>.</p>
