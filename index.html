	<h1>What would Nobel do…?</h1>
	<h2>…<strong>not</strong> award a prize<br />
	in economics!</h2>
</div>

<p>Nowhere in his last will did Alfred Nobel himself mention any prize in the so called “economic sciences.” This prize was in fact created by the Swedish Central Bank in 1968 – more than 70 years after Nobel’s death. The cleverly named “Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel” was of course too much of a mouthful to avoid its obvious destiny of being shortened to a “Nobel Prize in Economics”. Understandably so in popular speech, but more worrisome by the media and other institutions of critical and investigative reputation.</p>

<blockquote>In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. The Prize is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the Bank’s 300th anniversary.<br />

<p>The nomination criteria, selection process, prize money, and presentation of the prize in economics are all carefully matched to those of the Nobel Prizes, to the point where they are hard to distinguish from each other. And so, for many years has the late coming prize in economics basked in the reflected glory of the five actual Nobel Prizes, the ones specified by Alfred Nobel in his testament. Never without controversy though, as noted by the former chairman of the Nobel Foundation:</p>

<blockquote>Every now and then there are proposals to establish additional Nobel Prizes, for example in Mathematics or Environmental science. The foundation as well as the prize juries have rejected such requests. They consider themselves bound by the testament, wondering where it would lead to if new Nobel Prizes or equivalents were created. […] However, this principle has been departed from on one occasion, regarding the prize in economics. This prize must not be treated as a Nobel Prize and is for this reason titled Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. […] There was considerable doubt among the Nobel committees about accepting the prize. Propaganda activities were intense, especially from the Governor of the Central Bank, Per Åsbrink. […] The prize in economics continues causing controversy.<br />

<!-- This is the above quote in its original wording in Swedish:
Då och då kommer förslag om att man borde inrätta ytterligare Nobelpris, till exempel i matematik eller i miljövård. Stiftelsen, liksom prisutdelarna, har avvisat sådana propåer. Man har ansett sig bunden av testamentet – och frågar sig också var man skulle hamna om man släppte fram nya Nobelpris eller motsvarande pris. […] I ett avseende har man emellertid frångått principen och inrättat ett nytt pris. Det gäller ekonomipriset. Det skall inte likställas med ett Nobelpris och kallas också Pris i ekonomiska vetenskaper till Alfreds Nobels minne. […] Det rådde stor tveksamhet inom Nobelinstanserna till att acceptera priset. Propagandaverksamheten för priset var intensiv, särskilt från riksbankschefen Per Åsbrinks sida. […] Ekonomipriset har också fortsättningsvis varit kontroversiellt. -->

<p>A letter was recently sent to the Nobel Foundation for further clarification on this issue:</p>

<blockquote>I have a question on the terminology when writing about the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Since this prize was not in Nobel's will, can it formally be called a "Nobel Prize", in for example an article or book? Do you consider it correct to name a laureate of the Prize in Economic Sciences a "Nobel Prize winner" or "Nobel Laureate"?</blockquote>

<p>The reply from the Nobel Foundation reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>As the prize is not mentioned in Alfred Nobel’s last will, it is a memorial prize, with the formal designation being <strong>The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</strong>, or in short form: <strong>Prize in Economic Sciences</strong>. The formal designation of a recipient of the prize is <strong>Recipient(s) of Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</strong>, or in short form, <strong>Laureate(s) in Economic Sciences</strong></blockquote>

<p>The last will of Alfred Nobel clearly states the five areas in which a prize was to be awarded, namely physics, chemistry, physiology/medicine, literature, and peace:</p>

<blockquote>The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. The said interest shall be divided into <strong>five</strong> equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of <strong>physics</strong>; one part to the person who shall have made the most important <strong>chemical</strong> discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of <strong>physiology or medicine</strong>; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of <strong>literature</strong> the most outstanding work in an ideal direction; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for <strong>fraternity between nations</strong>, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.<br />

<p>Alfred Nobel did not mention any prize in economics.</p>
