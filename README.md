What would Nobel do?
--------------------

This is the source repository for [whatwouldnobeldo.org](http://whatwouldnobeldo.org/)

There is only the `gh-pages` branch, which when pushed to will build the live site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Developing locally is as easy as running `jekyll serve --watch` from the root directory.
